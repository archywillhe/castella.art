                  Castella 2122: A 100-year initiative for more expressions in post-humanism and altered state of consciousness.
                  <br/><br/>
                  The future of the next 100 years are not in us, but the younger generations that are being born, and yet to be born. We will solve global warming. We will discover new physics. We will have affordable space travel, and other new things... new inventions, new music, new experiences, new social structures... that we now know not of. Existing weapon systems will become obsolete, and so are old regimes, and mindless consumerisms and pollution and senseless wars and bad politics.
<br/><br/>
                  We will get there. 
                  Our dreams are far greater than ourselves. 
                  There are so much to human potentials that we do not know of. 
                  And I think that’s why we need arts. 
                  They can help us to explore and challenge that within us which we know little or nothing about, 
                  such as the manifestation of a certain feeling, the reconstruction of memories, representations, etc.

And I think that’s what art is about. 
It’s about exploring and challenging that within us which we know little or nothing about, 
such as the manifestation of a certain feeling, the reconstruction of some memories, representations, etc.
