  What is post-humanism? 
  <br/>

  <br/>
  I am an artist, what can Castella 2122 provide me?

  <br/>
  Is Castella 2122 a commercial project? 
  <br/>
  Yes and no. 

  <br/>
  Will Castella 2122 do NFT? What does Castella 2122 think about blockchains?
  <br/>
  No. We are much more interested in the physical world.
  And we are anti-NFT. Here are two reasons why we dislike it so much: 
  - Artificial scarcity is dumb. It is precisely what post-humanism is not about.
  We live in a world of abundance, not scarcity. 
  The only thing that is truly scarce is your existential time, powered by your organs working hard to keep the oxygen in, etc.
  We fail to see any meaningful way NFT can value-add to your time here in this world.
  <br/>
  - We think the popuarlity of NFT is a symptom of everything wrong with the modern society.
  <br/>
  It is interesting that blockchain-as-technology , 
  but . 
  Nonetheless, . 
  Green energy 2050. 
  When the cost justifies, we will likely transition into a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO).
